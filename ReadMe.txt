This is a fun little side project to test my programming skills and also tests VICs team of nerds.

all files to do with this challenge will appear here. challenges my include decryption, searching for data and file management/alteration (only to file contained in this file of course)
good luck and have fun.

P.S. there are extra hidden cyphers that are extra hidden that wont move the story but will give you a trophy :)
